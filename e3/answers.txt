1. When smoothing the CPU temperature, do you think you got a better result with LOESS or Kalman smoothing? What differences did you notice? 

ans:
LOESS looks better but I think it's because LOESS doesn't think a lot about the outliers. So I think Kalman is better than LOESS if a comprehensive comparison is made, because it considers more parameters and the data is more real and accurate.

2. In the GPX files, you might have also noticed other data about the observations: time stamp, course (heading in degrees from north, 0–360), speed (in m/s). How could those have been used to make a better prediction about the “next” latitude and longitude? [Aside: I tried, and it didn't help much. I think the values are calculated from the latitude/longitude by the app: they don't really add much new information.] 

ans:
In physics, we learned how to figure out the path of motion by direction, speed, and time of motion. We can use a similar approach, we know the time, the course and the speed, and we can use that to predict the distance in this direction, to estimate the next coordinate.
