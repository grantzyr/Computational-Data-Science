Q2: I gave imprecise English translations of what the by-week test, and the Mann-Whitney test were actually testing. Do the same for the original T-test, and for the transformed data T-test. That is, describe what the conclusion would be if you could reject the null hypothesis in those tests.

ans: 
For Original T-test: if i got reject H0(null hypothesis), the mean number of comments on weekedn and weekdays is different.
For Transformed data T-test: if i got reject H0, the square root of the mean number of comments on wweekeds and weekdays is different.

Q3: Of the four approaches, which do you think actually does a better job of getting an answer for the original question: “are there a different number of Reddit comments posted on weekdays than on weekends?” Briefly explain why. (It's not clear to me that there is a single correct answer to this question.)

ans: Limit center theory. When the limit centre theory is applied, it will hold true regardless whether population is normal or skewed.
